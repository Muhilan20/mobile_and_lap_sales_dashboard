This project presents a complete sales analytics dashboard for mobile and laptop products using structured, simulated datasets. The process began with data cleaning in Excel, correcting inconsistencies like wrongly entered brand names, and separating the datasets for mobile and laptop. Preprocessing and encoding were done in Python, followed by customer segmentation using K-Means clustering and RFM analysis, and product classification based on features like RAM, storage, and price. The final Power BI dashboard includes three pages: Home, Mobile Sales, and Laptop Sales, with interactive slicers for year and region, and page navigation buttons for seamless user experience. Though the dataset is not real, itâ€™s structured to reflect realistic business scenarios, showcasing the full lifecycle of a data science and BI project from cleaning to insight generation and visualization.# mobile_and_lap_sales_dashboard
